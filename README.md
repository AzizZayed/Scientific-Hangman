# Scientific-Hangman

A simple hangman game using the 118 elements from the [Periodic Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table). 

This was coded in Java with [AWT Graphics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html). This game is *harder than you think* and *very* addictive.

Instructions:

* Press Space Bar to change the word at any time 
* Have fun
